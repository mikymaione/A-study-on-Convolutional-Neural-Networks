# Study on the use of convolutional neural networks for the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation

## Abstract
In this study we will introduce atrial fibrillation, one of the cardiac arrhythmias, and see how it can be diagnosed using convolutional neural networks in combination with various methods and supervised learning models, including: gray-level co-occurrence matrix, short-time Fourier transform based spectrogram, support-vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, multi-layer perceptron, focal loss, multi-scale decomposition, time-frequency analysis.
